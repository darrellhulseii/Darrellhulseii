        <blockquote>"ADT has a good share of voice in the market through their advertising, which is how I knew about them. I've been a loyal customer for over 20 years now, and there's a good reason for that. From the outset, ADT had a good reputation and seemed well-equipped to meet all my security needs effectively.

Over the years, one thing that has really stood out to me is their outstanding customer service. The service team is incredibly patient, especially since technology can be challenging at times, particularly for those of us who aren't as young as we used to be. Whenever there were tiny hiccups with the system, they were quick to guide me through troubleshooting steps, which I've found immensely helpful."

<blockquote>"Over the 30 to 40 years I have been with ADT, my experience has been quite positive. Whether it was routine interactions or dealing with potential issues like false alarms or battery replacements, I've had no problems with their customer service. If asked by friends or family, I would confidently recommend ADT for their reliable service. The pricing feels fair, and I've always found their online features intuitive, all deserving high praise." -ADT customer Dante (consumer Affairs Sept 13th 2025) </blockquote>
